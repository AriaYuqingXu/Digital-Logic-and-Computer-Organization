The purpose of this lab was to apply the concepts we had learnt in class into practice, and it acted as a great warmup in regards to learning how to code in Quartus. We had already learnt about T flip flops, counters, and registers in lecture, but the lab gave us a more practical feel of how these devices were actually designed. The lab revolved around us building a stopwatch, which in effect is nothing more than a counter that counts time. To get a working stopwatch we had to take a series of steps and design a few different modules that we ultimately linked together. To start off, we needed T flip flops which are, simply put, circuits that take a stored value and toggle it (i.e. high becomes low, and low becomes high). To be able to store larger pieces of data at the same time, we also needed to create a register of such T flip flops, as our stopwatch would count from hundredths of seconds to minutes and thus only one flip flop alone would prove insufficient. Finally, we needed to create an actual counter that would increment the values stored in our register for the stopwatch to be able to count up. In the end, our circuit worked as we wanted and we successfully designed a working stopwatch by the end of the lab.
